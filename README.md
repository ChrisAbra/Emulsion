# Emulsion

Emulsion is a software which aims to accurately* model the effects of Negative Print film on Photographic paper* and produce colour accurate* base, raw* scans for further editing in traditional digital image-manipulation software.


We seek to measure the relative densities of each dye on developed film, model how photographic paper would respond to light attenuated by those densities to determine the densities of the dyes it would produce, then model how standardised light would reflect off that paper and be perceived by human vision. Only then do we push these measurements into a useable colour space such as Linear Rec.2020 for processing in other software.
